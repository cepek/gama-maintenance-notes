About

GNU Gama package is dedicated to adjustment of geodetic networks. It
is intended for use with traditional geodetic surveyings which are
still used and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or
high precision engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning
System (GPS) cannot be used.

Adjustment in local coordinate systems is fully supported by a
command-line program gama-local that adjusts geodetic (free) networks
of observed distances, directions, angles, height differences, 3D
vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with given
variance-covariance matrix). Adjustment in global coordinate systems
is supported only partly as a gama-g3 program.

Here are the SHA1 and SHA256 checksums:

The SHA256 checksum is base64 encoded, instead of the
hexadecimal encoding that most checksum tools default to.

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify gama-2.19.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
or that public key has expired, try the following commands to update
or refresh it, and then rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.
