		Gama version 2 for MS-Windows

  This README file describes how to set up and run a precompiled
  distribution of the latest version of GNU Gama for MS-Windows.  You
  can find the precompiled distribution on the ftp.gnu.org server and
  its mirrors:

       ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gama/windows/

  This server contains other distributions, including the full Gama
  source distribution, as well as older releases of Gama for Windows.

  Binary distributions in this directory are native Windows executable
  from MS Visual Studio 2019, based on alternative Gama cmake project
  builds.
