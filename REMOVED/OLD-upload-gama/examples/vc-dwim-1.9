I've just realized that the preceding release was nearly three years
ago. So this release was long overdue.

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature[*]:
  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/vc-dwim/vc-dwim-1.9.tar.xz
  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/vc-dwim/vc-dwim-1.9.tar.xz.sig

Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/vc-dwim/vc-dwim-1.9.tar.xz
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/vc-dwim/vc-dwim-1.9.tar.xz.sig

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify vc-dwim-1.9.tar.xz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 7FD9FCCB000BEEEE

and rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

This release was bootstrapped with the following tools:
  Autoconf 2.69.197-b8fd7-dirty
  Automake 1.16a
  Gnulib v0.1-3088-g6ad341ee4
