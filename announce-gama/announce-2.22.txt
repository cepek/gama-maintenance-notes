About

GNU Gama package is dedicated to adjustment of geodetic networks. It
is intended for use with traditional geodetic surveyings which are
still used and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or
high precision engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning
System (GPS) cannot be used.

Adjustment in local coordinate systems is fully supported by a
command-line program gama-local that adjusts geodetic (free) networks
of observed distances, directions, angles, height differences, 3D
vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with given
variance-covariance matrix). Adjustment in global coordinate systems
is supported only partly as a gama-g3 program.

Here are the SHA1 and SHA256 checksums:

The SHA256 checksum is base64 encoded, instead of the
hexadecimal encoding that most checksum tools default to.

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify gama-2.22.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1b77fc09

and rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

Changes in release 2.22 (2022-09-02)

  - Denny Fiedler reported inconsitent adjustment reports.
    XML adjustment ouput differed from text and html formats
    in description of Chi-square test of standard deviation.

    New XML tag <not-applicable/> was added to the adjustment ouput
    format for cases with zero degrees of freedom, where the standard
    deviation test is not applicable (previously there were only
    two tags <passed/> and <failed/>).

  - New gama-local adjustment XML output definition
    gama-local-adjustment.xsd version 1.02.

    Old XML output files are formally complient with the new XSD
    version 1.02, but three testing files were updated in the
    directory tests/gama-local/input/
       minimal.xml
       triangle-1.xml
       triangle-2.xml
