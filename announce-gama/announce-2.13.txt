To: info-gama@gnu.org, info-gnu@gnu.org


GNU Gama package is dedicated to adjustment of geodetic networks. It
is intended for use with traditional geodetic surveyings which are
still used and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or
high precision engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning
System (GPS) cannot be used.

Adjustment in local coordinate systems is fully supported by a
command-line program gama-local that adjusts geodetic (free) networks
of observed distances, directions, angles, height differences, 3D
vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with given
variance-covariance matrix). Adjustment in global coordinate systems
is supported only partly as a gama-g3 program.

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify gama-2.13.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1b77fc09

and rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

NEWS

Changes in release 2.13 (2021-01-15)

* Conversions between yaml and input xml (gkf) tested for all
  available data files in the tests suite (subdirectory gama-local).

* Command line programs gama-local, gama-local-yaml2gkf and
  gama-local-gkf2yaml can now read input data from standard input.

* New exlicit parameter --input-xml in gama-local (previously input
  file was the first parameter)

* Fixed test of ratio apriori/aposteriori values (localnetworkxml.cpp)

* Fixed implicit model for distance stddev (gama-local adjustment model)

* Fixed new attribute angular in documentation
