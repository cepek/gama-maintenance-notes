==================================================================

Here is the GNU gama home page:
    https://gnu.org/s/gama/

For a summary of changes and contributors, see:
  https://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gama.git;a=shortlog;h=v2.29
or run this command from a git-cloned gama directory:
  git shortlog v2.28..v2.29

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature:
  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gama/gama-2.29.tar.gz
  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gama/gama-2.29.tar.gz.sig

Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gama/gama-2.29.tar.gz
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gama/gama-2.29.tar.gz.sig

Here are the SHA1 and SHA256 checksums:

  08d5cc6a812e3b097f5f1fae290c5474a0883477  gama-2.29.tar.gz
  wA+jxv/053eDTfrgKvzP8uFIhPVE9ax1KgBH1W6AtBE=  gama-2.29.tar.gz

Verify the base64 SHA256 checksum with cksum -a sha256 --check
from coreutils-9.2 or OpenBSD's cksum since 2007.

Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify gama-2.29.tar.gz.sig

The signature should match the fingerprint of the following key:

  pub   rsa4096 2020-07-18 [SC]
        C6E1 824E 0180 B85F 31B0  6B6A CB6C E60D 1B77 FC09
  uid   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
or that public key has expired, try the following commands to retrieve
or refresh it, and then rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

  gpg --recv-keys 1b77fc09

As a last resort to find the key, you can try the official GNU
keyring:

  wget -q https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
  gpg --keyring gnu-keyring.gpg --verify gama-2.29.tar.gz.sig

Changes in release 2.29 (2024-02-19)

  The maintenance release, no user-visible changes in existing
  programs.

  - New helper program compare-xyz was added; the program is used in
    testing suite and currently is in alpha version.

  - There are two major programs in the GNU gama project: gama-local
    and gama-g3. The version of these two programs is same as version of
    the release, 2.29 in this release. Apart of tese two, there are also
    helper minion prorgam, used for example in testing suite. These
    minion program are:

      compare-xyz, gama-local-deformation, gama-local-gkf2yaml,
      gama-local-xml2sql, gama-local-xml2txt, gama-local-yaml2gkf and
      krumm2gama-local

    Changes in these programs normally need not to yield the change of
    the whole package. To avoid possible confusion between two different
    version of these helper programs, they vere assigned their own minon
    version, for example compare-xyz 2.29-0.3.
